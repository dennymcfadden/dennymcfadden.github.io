				I’ve always been a maker. As a child, my mom would send me out with a brush and a bucket of water to “paint” the sidewalk and I would be absorbed for hours. In high school, a <a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/2024/06/21/michael-iampieri-art-teacher-dies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a legendary art teacher</a> sparked my love for drawing, which led to a BFA in Graphic Design. But it was a undergraduate HTML/CSS course—coinciding with the launch of the first iPhone—that instilled a passion for software as a medium. For the past 15 years, I’ve been building digital products at early-stage startups—using design to make complex things simple and delightful.<br><br>
			Outside of work I pursue interests that combine teamwork, craft, and technology. Today you can find me:</p>

				<li>Competitive sailing (2024 <a href="https://www.bcya.com/organization" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BCYA</a> Champions)</li>
				<li>Playing team sports:  basketball, soccer, and ice hockey</li>
				<li>Drawing & painting at MICA (Maryland Institute College of Art)</li>
				<li>Restoring our family’s 1894 townhome</li>
